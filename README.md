## Features

- **Privacy-focused**: Keep your browsing history indexed locally - don't use remote search engines if it isn't necessary
- **Full-text indexing**: Search through the actual content of web pages you've visited
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Utilize a powerful [query language](https://hister.org/docs/query-language/) for precise results
- **Efficient retrieval**: Use keyword aliases to quickly find content
- **Flexible content management**: Configure blacklist and priority rules for better control
- **Local file indexing**: Index your local knowledge base
- **Crawler**: Use a (headless) browser or a traditional crawler to extend your index fast
- **Multi-user support**: Host it for your local community

## Development

**Requirements**: latest Go and NPM

- Clone the repository
- Build with `./manage.sh build` (or `go generate ./...; go build`)

To work on the web app with hot reload and automatic Go rebuilds:

```
npm run serve:app
```

This starts a Vite dev server (with HMR) and the Go backend (with auto-rebuild via [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)) concurrently.
