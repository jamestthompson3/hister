We are sorry that you are here. 🙁 Fingers crossed it won't be for long?

If all else fails, you can try asking for help&mdash;see the Community links in this page's footer.

## Common Issues

### Server won't start

- Check if port 4433 (or whatever was configured instead) is already in use
- Verify the configuration file syntax

### Web interface loads, but looks broken

If the main text loads, but seems jumbled up, and (most) images don't load, check that the `base_url` is correct in the server's config.
(Trailing slashes should be irrelevant, but you can try fiddling with them in the config and/or the browser's address bar; please file a bug report if this fixes the issue.)

### Extension not connecting

- Ensure your Hister server is running and up to date
- Verify the extension is configured with the correct server URL (should be the same as `base_url` in the server's config)
- Check browser console for errors (also, see below for debugging the extension itself)
- Check firewall settings

### Browser import fails

- Ensure your Hister server is running and up to date

## Debugging the Web Extension

The Web extension's logs will not be visible in the default browser console.
Instead:

### Firefox

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Press the "Inspect" button to the right of "Hister".
