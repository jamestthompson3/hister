## Command-Line Usage

View all available commands:

```bash
./hister help
```

### Index a URL Manually

To manually index a specific URL:

```bash
./hister index https://example.com
```

### Crawling Websites

Use `--recursive` (`-r`) to recursively crawl a website starting from a given URL.
Every crawl runs as a **persistent job** backed by the database, so it can be interrupted
and resumed at any time without losing progress.

#### Start a crawl

```bash
hister index -r https://example.com
```

A random job ID is generated and printed when the crawl starts. Keep it if you want to
resume later.

#### Specify your own job ID

```bash
hister index -r --job-id my-docs https://example.com/docs
```

#### Resume an interrupted crawl

Pass the same `--job-id` without any URL arguments:

```bash
hister index --job-id my-docs
```

Hister restores the original validator rules and picks up exactly where it left off.

#### Limit the crawl scope

| Flag                | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--max-depth N`     | Stop following links deeper than N levels (0 = no limit) |
| `--max-links N`     | Stop after visiting N pages in total (0 = no limit)      |
| `--allowed-domain`  | Only follow links on this domain (repeatable)            |
| `--exclude-domain`  | Never follow links on this domain (repeatable)           |
| `--allowed-pattern` | Only follow URLs matching this regexp (repeatable)       |
| `--exclude-pattern` | Skip URLs matching this regexp (repeatable)              |

Example: crawl only the docs subdomain, up to 200 pages:

```bash
hister index -r \
  --job-id docs-crawl \
  --allowed-domain docs.example.com \
  --max-links 200 \
  https://docs.example.com
```

### Managing Crawl Jobs

Use the `crawl` command to inspect and clean up persistent crawl jobs.

#### List all jobs

```bash
hister crawl list
```

Output shows the job ID, status (`running`, `completed`, `interrupted`), start URL, and
per-status URL counts (pending, done, failed, skipped).

#### Delete a job

```bash
hister crawl delete my-docs
```

This removes the job record and all associated URL tracking data from the database.
The documents that were already indexed are not affected.

## TUI (Terminal UI)

Hister provides a terminal-based user interface for searching your browsing history without leaving your terminal.

### Start the TUI

Run the search command without any arguments:

```bash
hister search
```

### TUI Features

- **Mouse support**: Scroll with mouse wheel, click to select, right-click for context menu
- **Theming**: Built-in color themes with interactive picker (press `ctrl+t`)
- **Settings overlay**: Edit keybindings interactively (press `ctrl+s`)

### Customizing TUI

TUI settings are stored in a separate `tui.yaml` file alongside your main config file. This file is automatically created with default values when you first run `hister search`.

**TUI config location**: `~/.config/hister/tui.yaml`

#### tui.yaml Structure

```yaml
# Theme settings
dark_theme: 'dracula'
light_theme: 'gruvbox'
color_scheme: 'auto'
# themes_dir: "/path/to/custom/themes"  # optional

# TUI keybindings
hotkeys:
  ctrl+c: 'quit'
  ctrl+t: 'toggle_theme'
  ctrl+s: 'toggle_settings'
  ctrl+o: 'toggle_sort'
  alt+1: 'tab_search'
  alt+2: 'tab_history'
  alt+3: 'tab_rules'
  alt+4: 'tab_add'
  # ... and all other TUI keybindings
```

#### Available TUI Actions

- `quit` - Exit the TUI application
- `toggle_help` - Show/hide the help overlay
- `toggle_focus` - Switch between input and results views
- `scroll_up`/`scroll_down` - Move selection up/down
- `open_result` - Open selected URL in browser
- `delete_result` - Delete selected entry from index
- `toggle_theme` - Open theme picker
- `toggle_settings` - Open keybinding editor
- `toggle_sort` - Toggle sorting mode
- `tab_search`/`tab_history`/`tab_rules`/`tab_add` - Switch tabs

Note: After modifying `tui.yaml`, restart the `hister search` command to apply changes.
